#Nodejs TodoList with express

This is an application from https://openclassrooms.com/courses/ultra-fast-applications-using-node-js/practical-exercises-the-to-do-list

which I used to practice Node.js.

It runs on localhost:8080;

Based on older dependencies used from the tutorial.

	 "dependencies": {
			"express": "~4.11.0",
			"ejs": "~2.1.4",
			"cookie-session": "~1.1.0",
			"body-parser": "~1.10.1"
	}

 You can run it by cloning the repo, and then cd into the directory & run

 ```
  	node todolist.js
 ```
